            <ul  id="tribute-info">
                    <li>Born on May 17, 1893 Covington, Kentucky, United States</li>
                    <li>His mother deserted him when he was a young child. His father struggled to raise him on his own, but by the time Frederick was 7 years old, he sent young Jones to live with a priest in Kentucky.</li>
                    <li> he was taken in by a Catholic priest in Kentucky, who enrolled him in elementary school.</li>
                    <li>He left school at age 11 and soon after began working in an auto garage and by 15 was made foreman of the garage.</li>
                    <li>In 1912, he landed in Hallock, Minnesota, where he obtained a job doing mechanical work on a farm which was filled with machines.</li>
                    <li> By the time he was twenty years, Jones was able to secure an engineering license in Minnesota.</li>
                    <li>Jones served as a WWI U.S. Army sergeant where he was often called upon to make repairs to machines and other equipment and returned to the farm after the war</li>
                    <li>When the town decided to fund a new radio station, Jones built the transmitter needed to broadcast its programming. He also developed a device to combine moving pictures with sound, hence expanding his interest in the 1930s</li>
                    <li>He designed and patented a portable air-cooling unit for trucks carrying perishable food. Forming a partnership with Numero, Jones founded the U.S. Thermo Control Company.</li>
                    <li>The company grew exponentially during World War II, helping to preserve blood, medicine and food. By 1949, U.S. Thermo Control was worth millions of dollars</li>
                    <li>best known as the inventor of various refrigeration innovations (including the compact freezing units used by trucks, trains, and planes to transport fresh food around the world</li>
                    <li>Jones received patents for 21 additional non-refrigeration inventions.</li>
                    <li>Portable X-Ray machines, movie theater ticket dispensing machines, automatic ice cream making machines, gasoline engines, window air conditioning units-we have Fred Jones to thank for those.</li>
                    <li> Jones received more than 60 patents. While the majority pertained to refrigeration technologies, others related to X-ray machines, engines and sound equipment.</li>
                    <li>In 1991, President George H.W. Bush awarded the National Medal of Technology posthumously to Numero and Jones, presenting the awards to their widows at a ceremony held in the White House Rose Garden</li>
                    <li> In 1944, he became the first African American elected to the American Society of Refrigeration Engineers.</li>
                    <li>Jones was the first African American to receive the award, though he did not live to receive it. He was inducted into the Minnesota Inventors Hall of Fame in 1977.</li>
                    <li>Died February 21, 1961 of Lung Cancer Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States</li>
